## Energy calculation
Maximum energy consumption:
- RS485 sensors: 0.5W(12V, 41.7mA / 5V, 100mA)
- I2C sensors: 0.1W(3.3V, 30.3mA), 0.6W(120mA, 5V)
- STM32F7 with all peripherals: 200mA, 3.3V
- Lora1278-C1 140mA, 3.3V
- ESP32-C3 350mA, 3.3V

Power energy of voltage regulator:
- 3.3V : 750mA <> 350 + 200 + 140 + 2x30.3
-   5V : 450mA <> 2x100 + 2x120 
-  12V : 130mA <> 3*41.7

Characteristics:
- Up to 3 RS485 sensors(up to 3 x 12V and 2 x 5V ): 1.5W
- Up to 2 I2C ( 3.3V or 5V): 0.2W/1.2W
- WiFi or Lora wireless communication: 1.15W/0.46W
